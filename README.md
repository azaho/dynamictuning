“_flag” means that an ordinal output will be added to the task, and “_sn” means that noise will only be added in the second delay. 
Running task_and_training will train the network (with parameters specified at top of the file) and save results of training to a new folder
You can then copy the corresponding python notebook into that folder and run it to generate and save all the figures

"_hd*" are hand-designed networks. Training only on top-level parameters and on the output layer.
